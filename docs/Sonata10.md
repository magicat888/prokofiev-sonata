# Piano Sonata No. 10 in B-flat major, Op. 138

### Sonata No. 10 in E Minor, Op. 137

- Prokofiev included the **Tenth Sonata** in his list of compositions, but the draft contains only **forty-four bars**.
- The manuscript is preserved in the **Russian State Archive for Literature and Art**. The first page was published in _S. S. Prokofiev: Materialy, Dokumenty, Vospominaniya_ in **1961**, while the second page was recently made public.
- The draft shows a connection to the **Sonatina in E Minor, Op. 54, No. 1**, written in **1931–32 in Paris**.

  - According to **Mira Mendelson-Prokofieva**, Prokofiev expressed a desire to revise the sonatinas and use them as the basis for the **Tenth** and **Eleventh** sonatas.
  - If completed, this would have been another sonata where Prokofiev adjusted a work originally written abroad to fit his new taste for simplicity.

- The sonata begins with both hands playing in **unison**, similar to the **Seventh Sonata**. The second theme (m. 28 of the manuscript) resembles the second theme of the first movement of **Sonata No. 9**, noted for its lyrical simplicity and haunting repeated notes.

- The surviving fragment is too short to speculate on the complete sound of the Tenth Sonata. Readers are encouraged to explore the **Sonatinas Op. 54**, which are included in volume 5 of the recording of Prokofiev’s complete piano works (**chan 9017**).
