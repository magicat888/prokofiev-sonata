Piano Sonata No. 10 in B-flat major, Op. 138

Sergei Prokofiev did not compose a **Piano Sonata No. 10 in B-flat major, Op. 138**. His piano sonata cycle ends with **Piano Sonata No. 9 in F major, Op. 103**, completed in 1947. There is no record of a 10th piano sonata in his catalog, and Op. 138 is not associated with any piano sonata.

Prokofiev's later years were marked by declining health and increasing restrictions under Stalin's regime, which limited his creative output. After the Ninth Sonata, his focus shifted to other works, including orchestral and chamber music, but he did not return to the piano sonata form.
