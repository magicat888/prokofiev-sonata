# Piano Sonata No. 1 in F minor, Op. 1 (1912) - listensing closely

m. 1-2: Play as one statement; phrasing extends from the second beat to the next downbeat. Ensure the bass line (B-flat–A-flat–G) is audible in m. 4.

m. 5: The long melody should be warm, with attention to the descending bass line and inner voices.

m. 19-23: Treat the four-note chromatic motive in the left hand melodically.

m. 26: The bridge section begins; pauses in the melodic line create breathlessness without breaking the melody. Listen to the bass line.

m. 34-36: Feel the meter change to 3/4. The left-hand part unfolds harmonically in waves.

m. 42: The second theme can be interpreted as either meditative or majestic. Ensure the rhythm of dotted quarters soars expressively.

m. 54-57: Chords should carry the melodic line without sounding too separate.

m. 58: Repeat the theme fortissimo with a sense of noble grandeur.

m. 74: Play the first part of the closing section expressively, maintaining a contrast with the second part in m. 82.

m. 96: The swell toward forte should be impressive; stay in pianissimo for as long as marked.

m. 119: Bring out both the low voice in the right hand and the top voice.

m. 134: The recapitulation begins; the first theme sounds hesitant and tentative.

m. 146: The recapitulation of the first theme is reduced to six bars, sounding vague and wandering.

m. 152: The bridge section reappears in C minor, leading to the second theme in m. 174.

m. 194: The closing material recapitulates in F minor, presented in a long, passionate line.

m. 218: The coda begins, based on the closing section material, with increasing excitement.

m. 240: The return of the introduction material leads to a determined conclusion.
