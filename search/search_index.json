Themes: The first theme is narrative and emotionally charged, supported by a triplet accompaniment. The second theme introduces contrasting material, and the bridge theme elaborates on the emotional content of the first theme. Development: The development section revisits and transforms thematic material, showcasing Prokofiev's ability to manipulate motifs and create tension through harmonic exploration. Recapitulation: The recapitulation presents the themes in a condensed form, with a more hesitant character, leading to a climactic coda that recalls the introduction.
